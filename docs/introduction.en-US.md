Ant Design Pro is a production-ready solution for admin interfaces. Built on the design principles developed by [Ant Design](http://ant.design/), this project introduces higher level components; we have developed templates, components, and a corresponding design kit to improve the user and development experience for admin interfaces.

Ant Design Pro is striving to provide an out-of-the-box development experience, for which we offer a complete scaffolding involving [the internationalization of the world](https://umijs.org/plugins/plugin-locale), [Permissions](https://umijs.org/plugins/plugin-access), the mock, [the data stream](https://umijs.org/plugins/plugin-model), [the network requests](https://umijs.org/plugins/plugin-request) Best practices are provided for scenarios common in these backgrounds to reduce learning and development costs.

At the same time, to provide a more efficient development experience, we have provided a number of column heavy components, [ProLayout](https://procomponents.ant.design/components/layout), [ProTable](https://procomponents.ant.design/components/table), and [ProList](<[https.ant.design](https://procomponents.ant.design/components/list)/>) are good helpers in the background in development, significantly reducing boilerplate code.

Let's take a big look at the architecture of the entire Ant Design Pro in the big picture below.
